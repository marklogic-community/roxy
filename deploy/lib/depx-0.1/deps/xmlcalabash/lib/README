Some of these jars are copied into the installer. Ideally, I suppose
I'd copy them all (plus others, perhaps), but I haven't worked out the
licensing issues.

The jars in here that aren't copied are used for the ant build
process. Make sure they're up-to-date with respect to the
distributions that you have on your CLASSPATH or you may get runtime
exceptions.
